# bq_Aquaris_E5_FHD-RecoveryChanger

<b>Android Studio Project - Recovery Changer App for bq Aquaris E5 FHD</b>

This app is compatible with any ROM running on offical KitKat and Lollipop (Beta 3) kernels.

Tested on: Official KitKat 1.2.2 | Unofficial CM12.1 | Beta 3 Lollipop

All Recovery files are included inside the apk so there's no need to download the recovery img files and flash them on the device like before.

This project is a "clone" of https://github.com/DcSoK/E6-recoveryChanger but, since the goal of the app is to change the recovery for a this specific device, I decided to create a new project instead of commiting changes to a new branch on the other project (which is meant for bq Aquaris E6).
